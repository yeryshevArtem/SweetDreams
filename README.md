## Firebase

Sweet Dreams uses Firebase as a storage and realtime database. In order to get an access to the server-side you need to create a firebase config file, name it as `config.js` and put in `./firebase` directory.

`config.js` must have the following format: 
```
// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "<YOUR_WEB_API_KEY>",
    authDomain: "<YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN>",
    projectId: "<PROJECT_ID>",
    storageBucket: "<STORAGE_BUCKET>",
    messagingSenderId: "<MESSAGING_SENDER_ID>",
    appId: "<APP_ID>",
    measurementId: "<MEASUREMENT_ID>",
};


export const WEB_API_KEY = '<YOUR_WEB_API_KEY>';
export const API_DOMAIN = '<YOUR_API_DOMAIN>';
export const AUTH_DOMAIN = '<YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN>';

export default firebaseConfig;
```
